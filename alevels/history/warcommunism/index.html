        <h1>War Communism</h1>
        <p>War Communism was a measure introduced by the government during the 1918 civil war in the USSR,
        the key reasons why it was introduced were to ensure that the red army were victorious by supplying them with enough
        food and resources. It also fit with the Bolshevik ideals over the long term to completely get rid of private companies; this
        was needed due to the financial chaos that the economy was left in after the first world war. Some people also saw
        the power to the people ideas of the Bolsheviks unworkable, this then gave them a solution to these issues.
        </p>
        <p>Some of War communism's most controversial issues were the food dictatorship that had been created, as well
        as the harsh labour discipline rules. For example, if you decided to go on strike, then the punishment was the death penalty.
        Furthermore, there was the removal of the free market, private trade of any kind was illegal. This then led to significantly bad econommic
        problems like hyperinflation, meaning money was useless.
        </p>

        <h1>NEP</h1>
        <p>NEP (or New Economic Policy) was an 'economic retreat'. Lenin found that war communism was not working and was causing extremely damaging
        effects to the economy. He proposed the NEP as a temporary solution which allowed them to revive the economy. 
        <h4>How successful was the NEP?</h4>
        <p>The NEP came with many successes. For example, industrial output rose greatly during the first three years. The NEP also repaired a lot of the damaged 
        infrastructure from the civil war. The harvests of 1922 and 1923 were especially good as well after the NEP was introduced.
        </p>
        <p>However, with the successes, come failures. Just to name a few: the corruption through the black market, the prostitution,
        and the gangs of thieving children. There were also imbalances in agriculture and industry. This then created the scissor crisis, this was where peasants and farmers were not
        growing grain due to the low price of agriculture goods. Perhaps the biggest issue with the NEP was that it wasn't truly communist.
        The private trading and the private industries being legalized again led to Nepmen, who were the capitalists who made a large profit from private companies. This
        directly contradicted Lenin and the Bolshevik's core values and of course started questions about whether the Bolshevik's were truly still communist.</p>
